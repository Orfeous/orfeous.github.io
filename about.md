## Who am I? (*Introduction*)

My name is Gabor, born and raised in Hungary.
I'm always keen to learn, explore and experience new things from gardening trough computer programming to quantum physics and discrete mathematics.
Any kind of science and technology is part of my interests. üòâ

One of my biggest achievement in life is to earn the love of a wonderful woman, who is now my Wife.‚ù§Ô∏è
Without her **patience** and support I wouldn't be the one who I am today.

On top of this I'm also father of three cat. üôÇ
Ozzy, Shiva, and Sandokan.


## What I do? (*My experience*)

At the moment I hold multiple roles within multiple companies.
However my main one is being a full stack engineer consultant for an insurance company.

### Experience

During my work at different companies I were able to gather knowledge in various fields. I have years of experience including but not limited in the following sectors:
 * Finance (Insurance, Banking)
 * Government
 * Tech
 * Industrial

and many others...

#### Programming (and other, like scripting) languages

I never liked the idea to be limited (by anything) so I learned every language which I needed to fulfill my projects.

 * Java
 * C#
 * Python
 * PHP
 * Unix shell
 * PowerShell
 * C++
 * C
 * Basic
 * Assembly
 * Visual Basic
 * Perl
 * Pascal
 * JavaScript
 * Go
 * R
 * Ruby
 * Bash
 * Batch
 * Kotlin
 * Lua
 * PL/SQL
 * Scala
and many other...

#### Systems
 * Jenkins
 * Ansible
 * Terraform
 * Red Hat Satellite
 * Puppet
 * Chef
 * Hadoop (+it's ecosystem (ex.: Kafka, Spark, Impala, Oozie, Hive, Pig, HBase, Flume, Kudu etc...))

 * VMware

Ahh god, this list would never end... I may continue one day. üôÇ

#### Methods

 * Agile
 * Scrum
 * Lean
 * XP
 * Waterfall

## And why? (*My motivation*)

As I usually say when someone ask why, technology is part of my personality. I grow up in a supportive environment where I was exposed to it.
As a kid I was sort-of forced to express my creativity (within technology) if I wanted to achieve something.
Like when I wanted to have a heavy duty mountain bike to do downhill, me and my brother built one from metal, some spare parts and using an electric wielder.
It was literally heavy duty. üôÇ
